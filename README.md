# GraphQL first tutorial

This is my first attempt at using GraphQL (technically my second, I started with this back-end project <a href="https://youtu.be/ZQL7tL2S0oQ">here</a> and then wanted to see how it works with the front-end)

Thanks to Youtuber Web Dev Simplied for the easy to follow instructions: https://youtu.be/0ZJI4cBS4JM

The endpoint is https://countries.trevorblades.com/. I used the fetch method and a query, first to get a dropdown list of continents. There's a change event listener on the dropdown list, so once the user selects a continent, a function runs with another query that populates all of the countries and their capitals for that particular continent.

I didn't use a framework. This is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, DOM manipulation, and a small amount of CSS.
